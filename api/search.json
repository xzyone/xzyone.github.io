Games have rules.\nGame rules indicate when and how it starts as well as when and how it comes to an end.\nGame rules provide contingency plans for when the activity goes away.\n\nRecreation\nAn activity in which people engage primarily for enjoyment and satisfaction (Dattilo &amp; Murphy, 1999).\nIt is a form of human activity or experience carried on voluntarily in one’s free time, usually pleasurable, and without extrinsic or practical purpose.\nIt is more organized and occurs during leisure time. • Some form of organized activity intended for social ends (Kelly, 1990).\n\nMeaning of Recreation\nVoluntary participation\nWide range of activities and experiences (sports, games…)\nIntrinsic motivation (personalpleasure)\nIndividual’s perception/feeling about the activity\nSocial acceptability (as against drug  use… )\nA social institution (collective  behaviour, values….)\n\nPlay\nPlay is a spontaneous form of leisure.\nPlay is chosen freely.\nIt involves a lack of seriousness in which interaction is free flowing, and it progresses from place to place and takes on new forms as focus, needs and demands shift (Denzin, 1975).\nIt is normally non-purposeful.\nWe incline to trade work for play.\n\nSport\nSport is leisure that involves institutionalized competitive physical activity. Three key concepts define sport: physical exertion, rules and competition of physical skills (Rossman &amp; Schlatter, 2003).\nOrganized competitions and usually governed by a set of regulations. Winning and losing is usually involved.\nSport (a more all-encompassing concept) vs. sports (a collection of separate activities).\n\n","slug":"7010","date":"2021-09-07T15:30:50.000Z","categories_index":"","tags_index":"Foundations,Sport,Management","author_index":"Xzy®"},{"id":"b8757c80aef8d1afc4d9393ffef91cec","title":"Marketing of Sport & Leisure Services","content":"Marketing Mix\n\n\nMarketing Mix\n&lt;&lt; what do you put to serve you target customer\nex.
